= AWS TEST SUITE ==

Test suite for asynchronous web server (Operating Systems assignment)

http://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/so/teme/tema-5

== FILES ==

README
	* this file

Makefile.checker
	* Makefile for automating the build process

run_all.sh
	* script to run all tests defined in scripts in _test/

== BUILDING ==

The local directory must contain the asynchronous web server executable
(aws). Use the Makefile.checker to properly build the sockop_preload.so
library:

	make -f Makefile.checker

This command will also run all tests and print out the results.

== RUNNING ==

In order to run the test suite run the run_all.sh script.

The run_all.sh script runs all tests and computes assignment grade (90
points maximum):

	./run_all.sh

In order to run a specific test ... pass the test number (1 .. 35) to
the _test/run_test.sh script.

Tests use the static/ and dynamic/ folders. These folders are created and
removed using the "init" and "cleanup" arguments to _test/run_test.sh.

== TESTS ==

Tests are basically unit tests.

Each test function follows the unit test patter: initialization, action,
evaluation.

Each test starts the server, creates a given context, checks for validity and
then terminates the server process.

== DEBUGGING ==

Logs are collected in test.log and wget.log files.
