This archive contains a test suite for testing the Operating System stdio
library for Linux (`libso_stdio.so`). The test suite consists of several
unit tests, each of them testing a different functionality of the library.

# Archive Files
The checker consists of the following files:
* `README.md` - this file
* `NMakefile.checker` - Makefile for automating the build process on Windows
* `GNUmakefile` - Cygwin wrapper over NMakefile.checke
* `run_all.sh` - script to run all tests defined
* `_test` - directory that contains the following:
  * `run_test.sh` - runs only a specific test
  * `test_lib.sh` - a shell library used to run tests
  * `src/*.c` - source code for each test
  * `src/so_stdio.h` - so stdio header
  * `Makefile` - Makefile used for building the tests
  * `work/` - directory where tests output files are stored

# Checker
The local directory must contain the so_stdio library (`so_stdio.dll` and 
`so_stdio.lib`).
Use `make` to properly run the entire test suite:
```
make all
```

# Debug
If you want to keep the output files after running a test, you have to set
the `DO_CLEANUP` environment variable to `no`:
```
DO_CLEANUP=no make all
```

In order to run a single test, you can manually run the `run_test.sh` script:
```
_test/run_test.sh init
_test/run_test.sh <test>
_test/run_test.sh clean
```
where <test> is an integer specifying the test number
# Cleanup
To clean the files generated by the checker you have to run:
```
make clean
make bclean
```
