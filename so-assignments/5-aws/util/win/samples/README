Use make to compile the echo server and the HTTP request reply once server.

> nmake

or use GNUmakefile wrapper if using Cygwin

$ make all


== HTTP reply once server ==

Start reply once server then use an HTTP client (such as wget) to request a
resource and then receive a reply. You may also use a GUI browser. The server
URL should be http://localhost:28282.

; on one console
> ./http_reply_once.exe

; on the second console
> wget http://localhost:28282


== IOCP-based echo server ==

Start the server and use netcat to connect to server and send messages. The
server will reply with the same message. The server listens for connections
on port 48484. You may download netcat from here:
http://joncraton.org/media/files/nc111nt.zip

; on one console
> iocp_echo_server.exe

; on the second, third, ... console
> nc localhost 42424

If netcat is unavailable, you may test using wget:

> wget localhost:42424

The server uses I/O Completion Ports for multiplexing connections and receiving
notifications. A specialized structure (struct connection) maintains
information regarding each connection.

Wrappers over I/O Completion Ports are defined in ../w_iocp.h.
