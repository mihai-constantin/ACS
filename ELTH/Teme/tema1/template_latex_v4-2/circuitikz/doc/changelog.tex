\begin{itemize}

\item
  Version 0.7 (2016-09-08)

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Added second annotation label, showing, e.g., the value of an
    component
  \item
    Added new symbol: magnetron
  \item
    Fixed name conflict of diamond shape with tikz.shapes package
  \item
    Fixed varcap symbol at small scalings
  \item
    New packet-option ``straightvoltages, to draw straight(no curved)
    voltage arrows
  \item
    New option ``invert'' to revert the node direction at paths
  \item
    Fixed american voltage label at special sources and battery
  \item
    Fixed/rotated battery symbol(longer lines by default positive
    voltage)
  \item
    New symbol Schmitttrigger
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Version 0.6 (2016-06-06)

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Added Mechanical Symbols (damper,mass,spring)
  \item
    Added new connection style diamond, use (d-d)
  \item
    Added new sources voosource and ioosource (double zero-style)
  \item
    All diode can now drawn in a stroked way, just use globel option
    ``strokediode'' or stroke instead of full/empty, or D-. Use this
    option for compliance with DIN standard EN-60617
  \item
    Improved Shape of Diodes:tunnel diode, Zener diode, schottky diode
    (bit longer lines at cathode)
  \item
    Reworked igbt: New anchors G,gate and new L-shaped form Lnigbt,
    Lpigbt
  \item
    Improved shape of all fet-transistors and mirrored p-chan fets as
    default, as pnp, pmos, pfet are already. This means a
    backward-incompatibility, but smaller code, because p-channels
    mosfet are by default in the correct direction(source at top). Just
    remove the `yscale=-1' from your p-chan fets at old pictures.
  \end{itemize}
\item

    capacitor, electromechanical device(motor, generator)
