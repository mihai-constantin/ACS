circuitikz
==========

This is CircuiTikz, version 0.7 (2016-09-08).

This package provides a set of macros for naturally typesetting electrical and (somewhat less naturally, perhaps) electronical networks.

It was born mainly for writing my own exercise book and exams sheets for the Elettrotecnica courses at Politecnico di Milano, Italy. I wanted a tool that was easy to use, with a lean syntax, native to LaTeX, and supporting directly PDF output format.

So I based everything with the very impressive (if somewhat verbose at times) TikZ package.

--------------

## Requirements
* Tikz graphics library, version 2
* xstrings not older than 2009/03/13

## Installation
The stable version is available on ctan and is included within the major latex distributions(Texlive, Miktex). If you want to test the latest version, have a look at http://circuitikz.github.io/circuitikz/. There you can find the latest git-version as a single file, just copy it to your project or to your local tex tree. 

## Usage
Just place
````latex
  \usepackage{circuitikz}
````
or, for ConTeXt, 
````latex
  \usemodule[circuitikz]
````
in the preamble and compile away, both with PS and PDF target output.

If you want to use or to try the git version, just append a git the package name:
````latex
  \usepackage{circuitikzgit}
````
or, for ConTeXt,
````latex
  \usemodule[circuitikzgit]
````
