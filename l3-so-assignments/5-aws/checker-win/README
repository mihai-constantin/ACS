= AWS TEST SUITE ==

Test suite for asynchronous web server (Operating Systems assignment)

http://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/so/teme/tema-5

== FILES ==

README
	* this file

GNUmakefile and NMakefile.checker
	* Makefiles for automating the build process

run_all.sh
	* script to run all tests defined in scripts in _test/

== BUILDING (in Cygwin) ==

The local directory must contain the asynchronous web server executable
(aws.exe) and the asynchronous web server object (aws.obj).
Use the GNUmakefile:

	make all

This command will also run all tests and print out the results.

== RUNNING (in Cygwin) ==

In order to run the test suite run the run_all.sh script.

The run_all.sh script runs all tests and computes assignment grade (90
points maximum):

	./run_all.sh

In order to run a specific test ... pass the test number (1 .. 33) to
the _test/run_test.sh script.

Tests use the static/ and dynamic/ folders. These folders are created and
removed using the "init" and "cleanup" arguments to _test/run_test.sh.

== TESTS ==

Tests are basically unit tests.

Each test function follows the unit test patter: initialization, action,
evaluation.

Each test starts the server, creates a given context, checks for validity and
then terminates the server process.

== DEBUGGING ==

Logs are collected in test.log and wget.log files.

== TOOLS ==

netcat for Windows (http://joncraton.org/media/files/nc111nt.zip)
