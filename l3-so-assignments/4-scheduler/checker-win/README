# Build (in Cygwin):

The local directory must contain the thread scheduler library
(libscheduler.dll) and its associated import library (libscheduler.lib).
Use the GNUmakefile to properly build the run_test.exe executable:

	make all

This command will also run all tests and print out the results.

# Run (in Cygwin):

In order to run the test suite you can either use the run_all.sh script or
the run_test.exe executable.

The run_all.sh script runs all tests and computes assignment grade (95 points
maximum):

	./run_all.sh

In order to run a specific test, pass the test number (1 .. 20) to the
run_test.exe executable:

	./_test/run_test.exe 1

# Debug:

For debugging, define the SO_VERBOSE_ERROR symbol.
